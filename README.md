# Ecommerce-apis
First I created Register/login/logout Apis and also implemented jwt authentication.
I used mongoDB to store data.
After that I created the needed models for category, order and products.
And at last created all the required apis required to tackle all the operations.
Since I did not created an administrator role I created some sample datas for categories and products. Which can be added to the database by firing urls 
"/api/category/add" or "/api/product/add".
